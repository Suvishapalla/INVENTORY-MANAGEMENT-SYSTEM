INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

I established a foundational project structure aimed at tool operations exploration, with a particular focus on efficient inventory management involving item addition and removal. The
project adopts a single-tier architecture, facilitating CRUD operations via HTTP requests to oversee the database system and software backend. For user interface development, Bootstrap 
was employed, while Postman and MongoDB were instrumental in managing the API and database components.
